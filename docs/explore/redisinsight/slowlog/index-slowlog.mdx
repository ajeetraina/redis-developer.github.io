A full-featured desktop GUI client, RedisInsight is an essential tool for Redis developers. It is a lightweight multi-platform management visualization tool that helps you design, develop, and optimize your application capabilities in a single easy-to-use environment. RedisInsight not just makes it easier to interact with your databases and manage your data, but also helps in managing Redis Cluster with ease.

## Getting Started with Redis Cluster

Redis Cluster is an active-passive cluster implementation that consists of master and slave nodes. There are two kinds of nodes: master and slave nodes. To get started with Redis Cluster, follow the below steps to build 3 Master and 3 Replicas. Please Note: In redis, slave nodes are generally called replicas as they hold the replicated slots that their masters have.
 
## Step 1. Install Redis from source

Follow https://developer.redislabs.com/create/from-source/ to build Redis from source

## Step 2: Executing the create-cluster script to setup 3 Master and 3 Replicas Cluster

 ```bash
  cd /utils/create-cluster
  ./create-cluster start
 ```

 ```bash
  Starting 30001
  Starting 30002
  Starting 30003
  Starting 30004
  Starting 30005
  Starting 30006
 ```

## Step 3. Access Redis Instance running on Port 30001 

 ```bash
  redis-cli -c -p 30001
  127.0.0.1:30001> set foo bar
  -> Redirected to slot [12182] located at 127.0.0.1:30003
  OK
  127.0.0.1:30003>
 ```


## Step 4. Verify the cluster nodes:

 ```
  cluster nodes

 ```


## Step 5: Set Protected mode off

 ```bash
  redis-cli -c -p 30001
  127.0.0.1:30001> CONFIG SET protected-mode no
  OK
  127.0.0.1:30001> exit
 ```



## Step 6: Connecting RedisInsight to Redis database
